# Simple-Database
This is simple database that stores data in encrypted file and also it uses a binary search tree to organize.
# Description
 I have created an object named 'Form', which has 6 strings (name,age,address,occupation,date of birth,and note) , accesor and mutator functions. This object will be stored in binary search tree when the program is running, how? basically each object has unique key thats generated by using the name and addres of the object. Database class inherits the binary search tree, and has its own operations. Finally, the Table class has map which can holds multiple database, and it has operation such as adding ,deleting and changing databases. Therefore, the purpose of this project is nothing academic related, I just did it for fun :), you can copy it. :) :) Thank You.
